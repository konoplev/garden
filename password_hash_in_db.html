<div class="paragraph">
<p>Password hash is not directly a cryptographic hash function. A password hash function (PHF) takes two inputs: the password, and a salt. The salt is randomly generated when the user picks his password, and it is stored together with the hashed password PHF(password, salt). (What matters is that two different accounts always have different salts, and randomly generating a sufficiently large salt is a good way to have this property with overwhelming probability.) When the user logs in again, the verification system reads the salt from the password database, computes PHF(password, salt), and verifies that the result is what is stored in the database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A password should not be stored as a hash such as SHA-1, but using a slower hash function such as bcrypt or scrypt or PBKDF2.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_good_password_hashing_functions">Good Password Hashing Functions</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_pbkdf2">PBKDF2</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PBKDF2 comes from PKCS#5. It is parameterized with an iteration count (an integer, at least 1, no upper limit), a salt (an arbitrary sequence of bytes, no constraint on length), a required output length (PBKDF2 can generate an output of configurable length), and an "underlying PRF". In practice, PBKDF2 is always used with HMAC, which is itself a construction built over an underlying hash function. So when we say "PBKDF2 with SHA-1", we actually mean "PBKDF2 with HMAC with SHA-1".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Advantages of PBKDF2:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Has been specified for a long time, seems unscathed for now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is already implemented in various framework (e.g. it is provided with .NET).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highly configurable (although some implementations do not let you choose the hash function, e.g. the one in .NET is for SHA-1 only).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Received NIST blessings (modulo the difference between hashing and key derivation; see later on).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configurable output length (again, see later on).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Drawbacks of PBKDF2:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>CPU-intensive only, thus amenable to high optimization with GPU (the defender is a basic server which does generic things, i.e. a PC, but the attacker can spend his budget on more specialized hardware, which will give him an edge).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You still have to manage the parameters yourself (salt generation and storage, iteration count encoding&#8230;&#8203;). There is a standard encoding for PBKDF2 parameters but it uses ASN.1 so most people will avoid it if they can (ASN.1 can be tricky to handle for the non-expert).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_bcrypt">bcrypt</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>bcrypt was designed by reusing and expanding elements of a block cipher called Blowfish. The iteration count is a power of two, which is a tad less configurable than PBKDF2, but sufficiently so nevertheless. This is the core password hashing mechanism in the OpenBSD operating system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Advantages of bcrypt:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many available implementations in various languages (see the links at the end of the Wikipedia page).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More resilient to GPU; this is due to details of its internal design. The bcrypt authors made it so voluntarily: they reused Blowfish because Blowfish was based on an internal RAM table which is constantly accessed and modified throughout the processing. This makes life much harder for whoever wants to speed up bcrypt with a GPU (GPU are not good at making a lot of memory accesses in parallel). See here for some discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standard output encoding which includes the salt, the iteration count and the output as one simple to store character string of printable characters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Drawbacks of bcrypt:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Output size is fixed: 192 bits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While bcrypt is good at thwarting GPU, it can still be thoroughly optimized with FPGA: modern FPGA chips have a lot of small embedded RAM blocks which are very convenient for running many bcrypt implementations in parallel within one chip. It has been done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Input password size is limited to 51 characters. In order to handle longer passwords, one has to combine bcrypt with a hash function (you hash the password and then use the hash value as the "password" for bcrypt). Combining cryptographic primitives is known to be dangerous (see above) so such games cannot be recommended on a general basis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_scrypt">scrypt</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>scrypt is a much newer construction (designed in 2009) which builds over PBKDF2 and a stream cipher called Salsa20/8, but these are just tools around the core strength of scrypt, which is RAM. scrypt has been designed to inherently use a lot of RAM (it generates some pseudo-random bytes, then repeatedly read them in a pseudo-random sequence). "Lots of RAM" is something which is hard to make parallel. A basic PC is good at RAM access, and will not try to read dozens of unrelated RAM bytes simultaneously. An attacker with a GPU or a FPGA will want to do that, and will find it difficult.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Advantages of scrypt:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A PC, i.e. exactly what the defender will use when hashing passwords, is the most efficient platform (or close enough) for computing scrypt. The attacker no longer gets a boost by spending his dollars on GPU or FPGA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One more way to tune the function: memory size.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Drawbacks of scrypt:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Still new (my own rule of thumb is to wait at least 5 years of general exposure, so no scrypt for production until 2014 but, of course, it is best if other people try scrypt in production, because this gives extra exposure).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not as many available, ready-to-use implementations for various languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unclear whether the CPU / RAM mix is optimal. For each of the pseudo-random RAM accesses, scrypt still computes a hash function. A cache miss will be about 200 clock cycles, one SHA-256 invocation is close to 1000. There may be room for improvement here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet another parameter to configure: memory size.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_salt">Salt</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The point of the salt is that if someone wants to crack a password, they&#8217;ll have to know the hash before they can start, and they have to attack each account separately. The salt makes it impossible to perform a lot of cracking work in advance, e.g. by generating a rainbow table.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Salt doesn&#8217;t protect you against a lone attacker who is only after one password. An attacker who just wants to break one password will calculate hash(salt + guess) instead of hash(guess) (if the password scheme is hash(salt+password)).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Salt helps if the attacker wants to break many passwords. This is usually the case. Sometimes the attacker is attacking a site and wants to break into an account on that site, any account. Without a salt, most of the attacker&#8217;s work can be used for all accounts, so she can test each of her attempts against all accounts at once. With a correctly-chosen salt (i.e. if no two accounts have the same salt), the attacker has to start over for each hashed password.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, in a sense, all password cracking attempts are attempting to crack all accounts passwords at once. That&#8217;s because hashes can be precomputed; all it takes is for someone to generate a table of hashes — or more efficiently, a rainbow table — and that initial work can be distributed to multiple attackers who can use it on any account database that uses the same password hashing algorithm. Again, salt makes these precomputations useless.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A brute-force password attack can be summarized like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make any precomputation that the attacker deems useful, such as building a rainbow table (which is an efficient way to represent a table mapping hashes to common passwords).
For every one of the n accounts that the attacker is interested in breaking in, and for every one of the p password guesses that the attacker includes in her dictionary, test whether hash(guess[i]) = hashed_password[j].
In a naive approach, the second step requires n × p hash computations to try all guesses against all accounts. However, if the first step already calculated all the possible hashes, then the second step requires no hash computation at all, just testing whether each hashed_password is in the precomputed database, so the attack requires just n table lookups (this can even be sped up, but we&#8217;ve already gone from n x p slow computations¹ down to n table lookups).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If each password has a different salt, then in order to be helpful, the precomputation would have to include an entry for every possible salt value. If the salt is large enough, the precomputation is infeasible. If the precomputation doesn&#8217;t take the salt into account, it won&#8217;t be useful to speed up the second step, because any cryptographic hash function “mixes” its input: knowing the hash of UIOQWHHXpassword doesn&#8217;t help compute the hash of NUIASZNApassword. Even to attack a single account, the attacker needs to perform p hash computations to try all guesses, already an improvement on the single table lookup that would be sufficient if the attacker has a precomputed dictionary.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_pepper">"Pepper"</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cryptographers can never let a metaphor alone; they must extend it with further analogies and bad puns. "Peppering" is about using a secret salt, i.e. a key. If you use a "pepper" in your password hashing function, then you are switching to a quite different kind of cryptographic algorithm; namely, you are computing a Message Authentication Code over the password. The MAC key is your "pepper".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Peppering makes sense if you can have a secret key which the attacker will not be able to read. Remember that we use password hashing because we consider that an attacker could grab a copy of the server database, or possible of the whole disk of the server. A typical scenario would be a server with two disks in RAID 1. One disk fails (electronic board fries - this happens a lot). The sysadmin replaces the disk, the mirror is rebuilt, no data is lost due to the magic of RAID 1. Since the old disk is dysfunctional, the sysadmin cannot easily wipe its contents. He just discards the disk. The attacker searches through the garbage bags, retrieves the disk, replaces the board, and lo! He has a complete image of the whole server system, including database, configuration files, binaries, operating system&#8230;&#8203; the full monty, as the British say. For peppering to be really applicable, you need to be in a special setup where there is something more than a PC with disks; you need a HSM. HSM are very expensive, both in hardware and in operational procedure. But with a HSM, you can just use a secret "pepper" and process passwords with a simple HMAC (e.g. with SHA-1 or SHA-256). This will be vastly more efficient than bcrypt/PBKDF2/scrypt and their cumbersome iterations. Also, usage of a HSM will look extremely professional when doing a WebTrust audit.</p>
