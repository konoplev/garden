<h2 id="_transactions">Transactions</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Transactions are needed to update data consistently (two clients update multiple objects or multiple parts of same object at once and DB needs to avoid conflicts during update).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ACID.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Atomicy - if one of the writes failed - previous writes discurded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consistency - uniqueness or foreign key constraints. but in general it&#8217;s your responisibility. DB can&#8217;t guarantee that users age and year of birth are consistent for example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Isolation - there are multiple levels, but in general one transaction should see changes made by parallel transaction (if parallel transaction made several writes, this transaction see all writes or no writes, but not some subset). It could lead to conflicts. Isolation Levels (see below) are how to avoid or resolve conflicts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Durability - commited data is always availiable. Even if there is a hardware failure. It&#8217;s your responsibility in most of the cases actually. Replication and stuff like this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Atomicy and Isolation: What could happen between BEGIN TRANSACTION and COMMIT if there are two transactions working on the same data.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_isolation_reads">Isolation. Reads</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One transaction reads and at the same time another transaction writes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Possible Problems:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dirty reads (If a transaction needs to update several objects, a dirty read means that another transaction may see some of the updates but not others)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non repeatable read (Read scew) (One transaction updates two tables another one reads updating data. Reading transaction see data from first table before writing transaction commited and the data from second table when writting transaction is commited. So the data is inconsistent for reading transaction)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First problem solution: keep new values unwritten until transaction is done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second problem solution: MVCC. Snapshot isolation.</p>

<h3 id="_atomicy_writes">Atomicy. Writes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One transaction writes and at the same time another transaction writes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Possible Problems:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dirty wrties (One client overwrites data that another client has written, but not yet committed. Almost all transaction implementations prevent dirty writes.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Solution: no dirty reads prevent dirty writes.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lost update (Two clients concurrently perform a read-modify-write cycle. One overwrites the other’s write without incorporating its changes, so data is lost. )</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Solution: exclusive lock (select for update MySQL), or optimistic locks and failed transaction in case MVCC shows that update lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Write Scew (Phantoms) (A transaction reads something, makes a decision based on the value it saw, and writes the decision to the database. However, by the time the write is made, the premise of the decision is no longer true)</p>

<p>PostgreSQL <em>Repeatable read</em> prevents lost update, MySQL&#8217;s repeatable read doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p><em>Dirty read</em>: One transaction tranfer money from Account A to B. Another transaction reads after money are gone from Account A, but has not been yet received by account B. Solution: keep both values and allow transaction to see only commited values.</p>

<h3 id="_solutions">Solutions</h3>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_snapshot_isolation_mvcc">Snapshot isolation (MVCC)</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea is that each transaction reads from a consistent snapshot of the database—that is, the transaction sees all the data that was committed in the database at the start of the transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because database maintains several versions of an object side by side, this technique is known as multi-version concurrency control (MVCC).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>how MVCC-based snapshot isolation is implemented in PostgreSQL. When a transaction is started, it is given a unique, always-increasing transaction ID (txid). Whenever a transaction writes anything to the database, the data it writes is tagged with the transaction ID of the writer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each row in a table has a created_by field, containing the ID of the transaction that inserted this row into the table. Moreover, each row has a deleted_by field, which is initially empty. If a transaction deletes a row, the row isn’t actually deleted from the database, but it is marked for deletion by setting the deleted_by field to the ID of the transaction that requested the deletion. At some later time, when it is certain that no transaction can any longer access the deleted data, a garbage collection process in the database removes any rows marked for deletion and frees their space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>an object is visible if both of the following conditions are true:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>At the time when the reader’s transaction started, the transaction that created the object had already committed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The object is not marked for deletion, or if it is, the transaction that requested deletion had not yet committed at the time when the reader’s transaction started.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How do indexes work in a multi-version database? One option is to have the index simply point to all versions of an object and require an index query to filter out any object versions that are not visible to the current transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another approach is used in CouchDB, Datomic, and LMDB. Although they also use B-trees (see “B-Trees”), they use an append-only/copy-on-write variant that does not overwrite pages of the tree when they are updated, but instead creates a new copy of each modified page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Snapshot isolation is a useful isolation level, especially for read-only transactions. However, many databases that implement it call it by different names. In Oracle it is called serializable, and in PostgreSQL and MySQL it is called repeatable read.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_2_phase_locking_2pl">2 Phase locking (2PL)</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>2PL is used by the serializable isolation level in MySQL (InnoDB) and SQL Server, and the repeatable read isolation level in DB2.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a transaction wants to read an object, it must first acquire the lock in shared mode. Several transactions are allowed to hold the lock in shared mode simultaneously, but if another transaction already has an exclusive lock on the object, these transactions must wait.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a transaction wants to write to an object, it must first acquire the lock in exclusive mode. No other transaction may hold the lock at the same time (either in shared or in exclusive mode), so if there is any existing lock on the object, the transaction must wait.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a transaction first reads and then writes an object, it may upgrade its shared lock to an exclusive lock. The upgrade works the same as getting an exclusive lock directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a transaction has acquired the lock, it must continue to hold the lock until the end of the transaction (commit or abort). This is where the name “two-phase” comes from: the first phase (while the transaction is executing) is when the locks are acquired, and the second phase (at the end of the transaction) is when all the locks are released.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since so many locks are in use, it can happen quite easily that transaction A is stuck waiting for transaction B to release its lock, and vice versa. This situation is called deadlock. The database automatically detects deadlocks between transactions and aborts one of them so that the others can make progress. The aborted transaction needs to be retried by the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Two-phase locking</strong> is a so-called pessimistic concurrency control mechanism: it is based on the principle that if anything might possibly go wrong (as indicated by a lock held by another transaction), it’s better to wait until the situation is safe again before doing anything. It is like mutual exclusion, which is used to protect data structures in multi-threaded programming.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_serializable_snapshot_isolation">Serializable snapshot isolation</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>is an optimistic concurrency control technique. Optimistic in this context means that instead of blocking if something potentially dangerous happens, transactions continue anyway, in the hope that everything will turn out all right. When a transaction wants to commit, the database checks whether anything bad happened (i.e., whether isolation was violated); if so, the transaction is aborted and has to be retried. Only transactions that executed serializably are allowed to commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How does it implemented? Write skew can be occured if there are any changes on results of query we used to make a decicion. So if some transaction read some data A and then write something and the data A is changed during the transaction, there is a potential write skew, so the transaction should be aborted. Transaction is not aborted imidiatly when we detected data A changes, because it can be read only transaction. So no reason to abort it. How data A changes are detected. If it&#8217;s MVCC the database needs to track when a transaction ignores another transaction’s writes due to MVCC visibility rules. When the transaction wants to commit, the database checks whether any of the ignored writes have now been committed. If so, the transaction must be aborted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It performs badly if there is high contention (many transactions trying to access the same objects), as this leads to a high proportion of transactions needing to abort. If the system is already close to its maximum throughput, the additional transaction load from retried transactions can make performance worse.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So it&#8217;s a snapshot isolation with additional checks for serializability.</p>
