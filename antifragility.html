<p>Antifragility - something that becomes better than it was before from accidents, mistakes, shakes and other unforeseen influences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is often impossible to calculate the risk, but we can always say that something is fragile and does not like risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are three categories: fragile, robust, and antifragile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fragile avoids mistakes, but sooner or later a large black swan will happen, which will destroy the fragile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For an robust error, it&#8217;s just information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the antifragile, errors are useful and they are not big. Through trial and error, the antifragile adapts to reality.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>King Mithridates IV took small doses of poison in order to become immune to large ones (if they try to poison him).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agrippina (Nero&#8217;s mother) did the same and her son could not poison her.
Vaccination is based on the same principle. This is proto-anti-fragility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hormesis - the effects of stress make the body better. Hunger, for example. This is antifragility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many people&#8217;s perceptions are highly domain dependent. The same thing looks different to them in different domains (contexts). Ask an American if you need an agency that will control prices and he will answer "of course not, this is communism." But that&#8217;s exactly what the Federal Reserve is doing.
Success, economic growth, and innovation result from overcompensating stressors. But we are not used to seeing this. Uncertainty, incomplete understanding, chaos and fickleness are members of the same family.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Layered redundancy is a central feature of natural risk management systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Redundancy doesn&#8217;t just help you get through a crisis. It can become a source of additional profit. If you have oil reserves, you can sell them profitably when the price of oil rises. A system with overcompensation properties always works at its limit: it creates new capacities and accumulates strength in anticipation of a worse outcome, reacting to a message about a possible danger. Comfort and predictability reduce system survivability. When people prepare for a disaster, they look at the worst that happened in history and think about what they will do in that case. The fool thinks the tallest mountain is the one he has seen. Nature always prepares with a reserve. If you work for wear and tear, the body will always collect enough resources to be able to do even more the next time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revolution and rebellion are antifragile. The more they are suppressed, the more people will be outraged by the suppression. Passionate love is antifragile. The more the object of adoration repels, the more hyperreaction is born in response, the stronger the feeling. The more a book is banned, the more people understand that it contains important and interesting information and the more people read the book. Information is antifragile. The best way to spread information is to keep it secret. If you are criticized, then you are important, you have hurt the critic. Since a well-known critic criticizes you, then you yourself are worthy of attention. A scandal almost never hurts a writer or artist. They are antifragile to scandal. The middle manager is fragile. If he punches someone in the face, he will be fired and will never be recruited with such a reputation. A taxi driver or a hard worker can kick in the face, nothing will change for them, they are robust to scandal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Antifragility is a property of the living. Mechanical cannot be antifragile. Another property of living things is complexity. Antifragility due to the participation of a large number of components and many ways of transmitting information.
An antifragile system benefits from stress, but only if it has time to recover. Hercules burned the severed heads of the hydra - he did not allow the antifragile system to recover.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hopemodel approaches economics like a washing machine without understanding the complexity, the many interdependencies, and subtle connections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Predictability is boring. It&#8217;s hard to keep a diet, but you don&#8217;t have time to think about lunch if it is not there and you hunt for it. Severe stress and relaxation are better than consistent, predictable levels. The best way to learn a language is when you have to speak it and don&#8217;t care about the rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The whole is antifragile due to the fragility of the parts. Restaurants are fragile, but due to their competition and the death of the weakest, the restaurant business lives and develops. Organisms and species reproduce by transmitting further genetic information. Due to random mutations and death of non-viable individuals, the fittest always survive. In the process of evolution, something that is higher than the organism on the hierarchical ladder gains benefit. A body cell is a community of intercellular molecules; an organism is a community of cells; species is a community of organisms. Strengthening of the species occurs at the expense of individual organisms, the organism is strengthened at the expense of individual cells. Hunger destroys the most non-viable cells first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want predictability, then you are fragile. If you crave rejection because most of the results will turn out to be beneficial to you, then you are antifragile.
Trial and error method. If the test gives you information that it is not a slave It means that you can see the correct decision more clearly, which means that each attempt becomes more valuable and you perceive mistakes rather as a cost.
The system learns from errors if they are localized. After each plane crash, flights become safer. Information is extracted from errors. The economy is fragile. After each bankruptcy of a bank, the next bankruptcy becomes more likely due to the fact that everyone is connected to everyone.
The one who has made many and frequent mistakes, but has not made the same mistake twice, is more reliable than the one who has never been wrong.</p>

<p>The more diligently you avoid small mistakes, the more damage the big ones will do. It is better to work for many small employers than for one large one. The first is the ability to choose the best and the likelihood of a white swan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Switzerland is the only country without a big government. Residents do not remember the name of the president. Governance takes place at the cantonal level. These are fluctuations from the bottom up. People solve their little problems at their level. Communication within a small team is completely different from communication within a large one. Scaling changes the quality. If you are a representative of a big government, for you numbers are just numbers. If you are the head of local government, you meet the people you govern in the church and you will be ashamed of your mistakes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We people despise everything that is devoid of specifics. A child crying next to us touches us more than thousands of people who die somewhere far away. The first is tragedy, the second is statistics. Bureaucrats make decisions based on statistics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is easier for a lobbyist to convince officials of a large government to make a decision in favor of a large corporation than to infiltrate a small community and convince its members.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mediocristan fluctuates (there are many changes, but all of them are insignificant), extreme stan jumps (it is stable almost all the time, but rare changes are very large-scale). By imposing restrictions on the first system, we will most likely end up with the second. Coainestan is highly unpredictable.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Medieval Europe consisted of pseudo-countries and city-states that fought among themselves. The war with some forced to make peace with others (too small to fight on several fronts at once). The system fluctuated, but was stable. As soon as the small pseudo-countries united into the nation-states of Germany and Italy, the world was shaken by two world wars. It&#8217;s the same with the economy. If the winner takes it all, the system can be overwhelmed by one major event. Randomness is concentrated, not scattered. The system looks stable based on history, but risk is not in the past, but in the future. It&#8217;s a turkey problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the currency is artificially stabilized, any deviation from the usual rate will cause panic. If a 10-year-old person comes home at exactly 6, then being 5 minutes late will make his family very worried. Small vibrations in the form of fires are good for forests, they destroy combustible materials. If fires are avoided, materials will accumulate on a huge fire, which can burn an entire forest to the ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A donkey with the same hunger and thirst, standing in the middle between a bucket of water and food, can die because it cannot decide where to go. The best way to help him is to nudge him in a random direction.
Weak signals that are too small to be heard can be amplified by interference with random noise and interference. Randomness can improve searches. Accidental drilling is more efficient than any other exploration method. Regicide was a way to accidentally reshuffle the country&#8217;s ruling elite.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Iatrogenism is the intervention of doctors that makes the patient worse. If the risk of treatment outweighs the potential benefit, then it is better to refuse treatment. More people die at the hands of doctors than from car accidents. The problem of "principal-agent" still works here (and the agent has a personal interest, which does not coincide with the principal using the agent&#8217;s services). The broker and the doctor care more about their bank account. Politics cares about his career.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Naive intervention wastes energy that could have been used for useful purposes. Overly zealous editors miss outright typos, but correct what is already good. People often over-intervene in situations that yield minimal benefits (and high risk), and under-intervene in areas where intervention is required because the situation is critical.
Selling "look what I did for you" is much easier than "look what I dodged for you." The doctor will not receive a reward if he advises to abandon an expensive operation and allows the body to heal on its own.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Procrastination can be a good thing. Sometimes it&#8217;s better to wait and let the situation decide on its own than to intervene. You won&#8217;t procrastinate if there is a fire. The best test for fragility is time, because it introduces large doses of clutter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The neurotic reacts to the slightest changes and swells out of an elephant fly. The more often and louder he rages, the more he is ignored. A cold-blooded person does not pay attention to minor problems. If he reacts, people know that something serious has happened. The neurotic responds to noise, is cold-blooded to information and ignores noise. Failure to distinguish signal from noise is the cause of over-interference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The more information, the less signal there is and the more noise. Every day the media needs to write about something. Even if nothing important has happened, the newspaper will not come out empty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When tightly controlled systems collapse (because of their fragility), it is usually said that the cause of the collapse is in the wrong predictions. It is foolish to blame the last truck that drove over it for the destruction of the bridge. And it is completely foolish to try to predict which vehicle will destroy the bridge. But this is exactly what they are doing. It is easier to strengthen the bridge supports. Unlikely events in politics and economics are unpredictable and cannot be measured scientifically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Forecasts are harmful because people believe in them and start taking risks based on them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The robust and antifragile does not need an accurate understanding of the world, and therefore no predictions. The more redundancy you have, the less predictions you need. If you have a bank account and stocks of basic necessities at home, then it is not so important what event will complicate your life: war, revolution, earthquake, recession. If there are no reserves and you are fragile, then the future needs to be foreseen much more accurately.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea is to get out of the influence of black swans or minimize the damage from any of them, not to try to predict them.</p>

<h2 id="_a_world_without_predictions">A world without predictions</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How to get rich on predictions without making them? It is necessary to bet on bankruptcy those who make forecasts and follow them. The more they believe in predictions, the more they risk.</p>

<h3 id="_stoicism">Stoicism</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Success leads to asymmetry. Now you can lose more than you gain. Therefore, you are fragile. Pain from the thought of loss than the joy of adding wealth. If the pain of losing 1,000 is higher than the joy of acquiring 1,000, then it is asymmetrical and you are fragile. Seneca developed a method to combat wealth addiction. One must imagine that the wealth has evaporated. So if the rich man loses something, he will not feel pain. It&#8217;s like buying insurance against damages. Another advantage of this method is that if you take risks, you are very well aware of the possible negative scenario, so that the changes for the worse are limited and known.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Seneca also proposed to share anger and fair retribution. He punished the servants only a day after the incident. Another tip: invest in good deeds. Wealth may leave us, but virtuous deeds will remain with us.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wealth is the slave of the sage and the lord of the fool.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Calculation of costs is simple: these are all items of expenses; if some expenses are returned, this is net profit; if they do not return, this is not a loss - I gave something in order to give it back.
This is how Seneca reduces expenses and keeps income. Mental accounting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you lose less than you gain, that is, your income is always more than expenses, then you like changeability (in the end, you will not be at a loss). This is antifragility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fragility - when vice versa.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your losses are less than your gains, the lack of volatility can hurt you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step to antifragility is to reduce losses, not increase acquisitions. Consistency is important. If you first have a kidney stone removed and then anesthetized, this is not the same as the reverse sequence. If a thing is fragile, it doesn&#8217;t matter how much you get, if at some point everything can break. If you are flying through the city at a speed of 400 km. per hour, then your effective speed is equal to zero, because at some point you will crash.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Barbell strategy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Store 90% in cash or inflation-protected funds, and invest 10% in high-risk securities. Maximum losses are known, maximum benefits are not limited. You avoid the middle, when all the money is invested in the middle risk and it works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The barbell&#8217;s strategy is to defend against bankruptcy (complete failure), but allow the white swans. People do the opposite. They are insured against probable problems (frequent and predictable), but remain fragile for rare, but destructive ones.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea of ​​an option is that you have a right, but not an obligation. Thus, you have a choice. When there is more information, you can exercise the right if it is beneficial. Or do nothing (but not lose anything). This is a positive asymmetry. You either win or you don’t lose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, it is a trial and error method. But the damage from mistakes is limited, and the benefits can be infinitely large. This method requires a rational approach to distinguish between favorable and unfavorable outcomes. Each trial gives you information that you didn’t have before (if it doesn’t, you repeat mistakes, which means you’re not rational). Each new step is crowned with success with more likely (you check the most probable scenarios first and after making sure that they did not work, move on, bringing the probability of a positive outcome closer from both sides (theoretical and practical)).</p>

<p>If we imagine that scientists are giving lectures to birds, in which they explain how birds fly and after the lectures the birds take off, scientists can think and tell everyone that birds fly thanks to lectures. The story belongs to those who write it.</p>

<p>If research is funded and a discovery is made, then we are told that it is due to directed research. But no one talks about unsuccessful studies.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The generally accepted cycle of the origin of knowledge: scientific community &#8594; applied science and technology &#8594; practice</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But this is: mathematics &#8594; ornithological navigation and wing-flapping technology &#8594; (ungrateful) birds fly</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In reality, this is often an endless cycle: haphazard adaptation (antifragile) &#8594; heuristics (technologies) &#8594; practice and training in a craft &#8594; haphazard adaptation (antifragile) &#8594; heuristics (technologies) &#8594; practice and training in a craft &#8594; haphazard adaptation (antifragile) &#8594; heuristics (technologies) &#8594; practice and learning a craft &#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And parallel to this cycle: Practice &#8594; scientists theories &#8594; scientists theories</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teaching birds to fly is an epiphenomenon. We see A and B and we tend to think that A breeds B or B hits A. In rich countries, a lot of money is spent on research, which means that research breeds wealth. There are many examples where education did not improve in countries, but income improved (Korea, in comparison with Argentina, was at first poorer and less educated, then it became richer, but not more educated). Russia is a country with a very good education, but very poor.
Granger developed criteria for refuting epiphenomena. For example, can A happen without B. Should A always follow B in time.</p>

<p>The one who convinces can only state those facts that confirm his point of view. We expect this in advertising. When we are told how science helps humanity - no (mathematics can lead to an economic crisis).</p>

<p>The halo effect - a person who speaks well is likely to run a business well. A chess player in life calculates all the steps in advance. The misconception is that one aspect is transferred to something completely unrelated to it. This phenomenon is essentially inversely dependent on context.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Prometheus (thinking before) and Epimetheus (thinking after) are two brothers of the titan. Epimitheus is a person who retroactively distorts reality in his narrative, adjusting facts to fit theories. Act, naively believing that the future is a projection of the past, described by some kind of narrative. The only way to domesticate uncertainty is to act out of asymmetry, where big wins are associated with small losses. When you believe too much in theory, you forget about the unpredictability of the future and become too self-confident and therefore fragile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A child does not need to know formulas and all the mathematics and physics that describe equilibrium in order to ride a bicycle. Do traders need probability theory then? _Traders trade &#8594; traders learn to use methods and tools &#8594; theoretical economists derive formulas and say that traders apply them &#8594; new traders trust theorists &#8594; disaster (theory makes the economy fragile) _</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Guy Bozhuana writes that in the 13th century no more than 5 people in Europe knew how to divide one number by another. Buildings were built without any mathematics and they were more durable, because when you rely on mathematics you don&#8217;t make a reserve. The industrial revolution was not made by scientists, but by people who tried to increase the profits of their production. The steam engine has been around for hundreds of years, but it was only used when it was needed. Venture investors invest more often in a person than in a business plan. If the plan fails, then it is important that the person can steer out of it. In extreme republics, where losses are limited and potential profits are huge, it is better to invest in many small and different ones than in one, but reliable (diversification).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People differ from animals in that they cooperate. And the return from two people is more than the sum of the returns from one and the other separately, from three - more than the sum of three, and so on. This is a non-linear function. But cooperation cannot be directed, you can only create an environment that is conducive to cooperation. A negative example is innovation at Skolkovo.</p>

<p>Corporations believe in business planning. But it blinds and causes the corporation to miss out on opportunities.</p>

<p>Anyone who is forced to learn when bored is more likely to mess around. Anyone who learns out of interest simply moves on to the next book. Boredom is associated with a particular book, not reading in general. Getting stuck in a loop is boring. Trial and error is freedom. You learn by moving to where it is interesting.</p>

<p>Rational knowledge is dangerous because creates the illusion of understanding. Thinking that we know how the world works and works, you can easily get into an unpleasant sti. It takes empirical knowledge to balance. Information obtained as a result of the adaptation.
The government cannot control prices, therefore the knowledge of what the price should be is smeared over society (prices are determined by those who participate in each specific transaction), therefore this knowledge is not available to the government.</p>

<p>Philosophers talk about truth and falsehood. In life, people talk about returns, vulnerability, and consequences (risk and reward), hence fragility and antifragility. And sometimes philosophers, thinkers, and researchers confuse Truth with risk and reward.</p>

<p>True - the event occurs with 100% probability (False - 0%). But we don&#8217;t make decisions based on probability. What is the probability that one of the passengers is a terrarist? One hundredth of a percent? This is almost a lie. But all passengers are checked for weapons, as if this is almost true. The fact is that it is not the event itself that is important, but the return. We are fragile here, so we check everyone.</p>

<p>How to define fragility? The damage caused to a fragile thing by shocks increases with the intensity of these shocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>nonlinearity: the damage from a stone thrown at the head is significantly greater than if this stone is crushed into small ones and thrown one at a time. If you jump from 10 meters, the person will crash. If 10 times from a height of a meter - no.</p>

<p>The fragile lives, because the impact on it with something big is rare. Otherwise, everything around would be destroyed very often. The fragile undergoes minor influences. And there are always more ordinary events than exceptional ones. The world was shaking and it settled down. What we know is a world in which probabilities have destroyed everything fragile that did not survive the usual (now for us) events. Therefore, extraordinary events rarely happen. We live in balance. Every day about 8000 earthquakes occur on the earth below 2 points on the Richter scale. Shakes from 6 balls are rare and get into the newspapers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The aggregate of small events affects a fragile thing to a lesser extent than a single event, which is equivalent in strength to this aggregate.</p>

<p>shocks bring more benefit to antifragile things (and, accordingly, less harm) as their intensity increases (up to a certain level).</p>

<p>If you are at twice the risk, but your losses will more than double, then you are fragile, if not, then robust.
The antifragile benefit grows the same way, so it is better to eat unevenly (today a lot of protein, tomorrow a fast, the day after tomorrow a meal rich in something else) and run instead of walking. Unevenness is used by physical education. The body reacts to stress in an anti-fragile way.</p>

<p>Small is always beautiful. Because of the economies of scale, people love to build large organizations. But a cat falling from a height greater than its height will not break its legs, but an elephant will break. Large non-linear increases its costs in times of crisis and lack of resources. Feeding an elephant is harder than a cat.
If a big one can be broken down into small parts, then problems can be avoided. The construction of the tunnel is monolithic, the construction of the road can be done in pieces and avoid losses in case of unforeseen circumstances. It is absolutely wrong to base your calculations on success and forget about the likelihood of failure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Projects tend to increase in price or / and drag out over time. And it&#8217;s not just the scale. The Empire State Building was built ahead of schedule. Modern construction is often delayed. The fact is that more and more intermediaries are participating in projects, the number of nonlinear connections and the probability of error are growing. The error results grow non-linearly. At the same time, errors affect only one direction - negative. It&#8217;s the same with wars and state budgets. It always takes more time and money than planned because armies and budgets are large. The economy is becoming more efficient, but because of the fragility generated by optimizations, mistakes are costing more and more.
Due to economies of scale, the influence of people on the planet can greatly increase. The consumption of a particular product leads to its deficit. If everyone starts eating tuna, it will disappear. All tourists want to go to Venice, so in July there are not many tourists there.</p>

<p>Do not try to wade the river, the average depth of which is 1 meter.
The deviation from the mean is important. The mean is a simplification of the model so much that it cannot be predicted.
People confuse function argument behavior and the function itself.
The more non-linearity, the more the function differs from the argument.
The more the argument deviates from the mean, the more the function deviates.
Philosopher&#8217;s Stone: if the average value of a function (x * x, for example) is greater than the value of a function from the average argument, then the function is convex, if on the contrary, then it is concave.
In the case of a convex function, you can make mistakes in predictions more often, but you still win in the end. In the case of a concave, the opposite is true.
If the recoil is linear, then you need to be right more than half the time. A convex function has the mean of the square of the return greater than the square of the mean of the return. The difference is the hidden benefit of antifragility.</p>

<p>Due to chance, we do not know if a person has achieved success thanks to their skills and abilities, but we know the opposite. If a person does not have the skills and abilities, in the end he will fail.
A charlatan can be someone who explains how to do something (these tips are quickly forgotten), but a professional is more likely to tell you how to avoid a negative scenario.
We know more about what is not true than about what is true. Negative knowledge (knowing what doesn&#8217;t work) is more robust to error than positive knowledge (knowing what is right and working). What seems right today may not be true tomorrow, but what is wrong is likely to remain wrong.</p>

<p>Less is more. Physics doesn&#8217;t have to rely on statistics. Economics and sociology need. Behind a bunch of statistics and formulas, you can&#8217;t see that most of the evidence proves nothing. The socio-economic world is ruled by black swans, which are impossible to predict.</p>

<p>If you have more than one argument to do something, don&#8217;t do it. This means that you are trying to convince yourself. Obvious solutions (robust to errors) require no more than one reason.
If someone attacks a book or concept for more than one reason, it can be ignored. Nobody says: "He is a criminal who killed a lot of people, and he also behaves disgustingly at the table, his breath smells and he drives a bad car." A philosopher should be recognized by one idea. A large CV is a sign of emptiness.</p>

<p>When we predict the future, we think about what&#8217;s new. But time acts by destroying the old. Seizes things foreign to the times to come. New will appear too. One fragile is replaced by another. But this is impossible to predict. The more long-term your forecast, the less accurate it is (more black swans will happen over a longer period of time).
Time destroys everything, even the most persistent. But the fragile will collapse before the antifragile.
The past, if you look at it correctly, tells much more about the future than the present. We need to recognize the importance of what surrounds us - what has survived.</p>

<p>Neomania is a striving for novelty. We quickly get used to fragile technologies and want new ones. New phone, new computer, new car. The difference with the old ones is not great, but we are ready to spend a lot of money on it (an outdated thing is quickly becoming cheaper). But you don&#8217;t want to change old things.
The metric system is also a striving for novelty. It sounds logical, but a foot is a foot and we can quickly figure out what 30 feet looks like. An inch is a thumb. The meter is more difficult to imagine. We have no intuition here.
Neomania is fragile. Science strives to be new and make discoveries. Most of the discoveries are inflated, because you need to talk about what something to tell. Time determines value. If you take an old textbook, the information from it will most likely be relevant. Take notes from conferences a couple of years ago and they are most likely already rotten and not relevant.</p>

<p>Is there any evidence that smoking is harmful? Nature is smarter than us (it exists longer) and it is necessary to prove a deviation from it. Intervention is potentially more dangerous than non-interference. And it should only be done if it is absolutely necessary (the potential harm from a lack of intervention is higher than the potential side effects of an intervention). It is very difficult to come up with a medicine that nature has not invented itself in the process of evolution. Everything that Mother Nature does is scientific until proven otherwise; everything that humans and science do is wrong until proven otherwise.</p>

<p>Irregular exercise followed by recovery is beneficial. We know that. But the same can be applied to food. Irregular fasting and fasting helps the body to be antifragile. The food must be deserved.

<p>Real freedom is the freedom to have your own opinion. You cannot be backed up against the wall and forced to do what under other circumstances you would not do.

<p>The more data, the more information, including incorrect information. In huge amounts of information, large deviations are much more often noise (or variations), and not information (signal). This is a property of sampling. In fact, when you are watching the process in real time, large deviations are very important. But if a scientist deliberately seeks from, they often lead away from the truth. The freedom of action of the researcher lies in the fact that he is free to choose the data confirming his point of view and to conceal others.</p>
