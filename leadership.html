<p>A leader is someone who opens new horizons for people.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_cooperation_and_intersubjectivity">Cooperation and Intersubjectivity</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People cooperate to be more efficient together. To be a company members need to have a common goal and share information efficiently.
That&#8217;s why transparency, diversity, and inclusiveness are benefitial.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The easier to bring information to the right people, the more efficient the company.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_leadership">Leadership</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It could be split into 3 factors:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>People - the ability to find the best team-players, assign roles, delegate, motivate, define culture and principles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goals - the ability to plan, assign tasks, define processes, monitor progress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication - ability to communicate, provide feedback, mentorship, and conflict solving</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_people">People</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A leader brings a role model. If a leader doesn&#8217;t grow, the company doesn&#8217;t grow also.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dictatorship doesn&#8217;t work because in such an environment nobody feels safe. People should feel safe to try and fail, otherwise, there will be no motivation to grow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Truth is more important than revenue. Without truth, there will be no trust. Mistakes shouldn&#8217;t be hidden. They should be used to grow. So, feedback is beneficial.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s ok to fail sometimes. If you take responsibility (you&#8217;re responsible for the result) then it&#8217;s ok to fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A company should define who we are, what our values are?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main responsibility of a leader is to provide people with energy. So, a leader should be able to manage energy. For example, a leader should be like a roly-poly toy if any problems are faced (this will be copied by people as well (see role model)).</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_hiring">Hiring</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The right "who" will answer to "what" and "how".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Avoid stress during the interview.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Questions (with purpose) for an interview:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why did you decide to work at X (a company from the CV) - ability to make the right decision
What are your achievements (responsibilities) at X - the ability to analyze achievements (understanding responsibilities).
How did you deal with the failure? - the ability to take responsibility
What would you like to change in yourself - the ability to see weaknesses and improve. And also honesty.
What type of people you don&#8217;t like? How do you deal with them? - self-control, the ability to be constructive
What&#8217;s your manager&#8217;s/peer/reporter name? If I call him/her how he/she will evaluate you from 0 to 10. What do you need to be 10?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the answer to 3 is that the problem happened because of someone else this is an indicator that a person can&#8217;t take responsibility. The good answer is that I fucked up and I improved something to avoid it in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hard skills: What&#8217;s the most interesting problem you had. How did you solve it? For any answer, ask why did you choose this solution as many times as you need to find which other options were considered and how the decisions were made.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_motivation">Motivation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Intrinsic motivation should be checked during hiring. It&#8217;s not possible to motivate somehow is not motivated at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ways to motivate:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ownership
public praise
help to grow</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1- There is an area of responsibility. A person should understand what is the contribution to the company&#8217;s success. Shares(options) is a form of ownership.
2 - We are social animals. It works only when everyone understands what is the achievement. The praise shouldn&#8217;t be done often, othervise it will not be valuable.
Feedback: if it&#8217;s negative the form should be not "You did it wrong", but "I&#8217;m upset about results".
3 - it should be clear how to achieve the next level. You can use gamification for that. The next level is more responsibility (see 1), so the higher the level the more possibility to be impactful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How to kill motivation:
Bad environment and unfriendly peers
Meaningless tasks</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_delegate">Delegate</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let someone else to perform your task. Otherwise, you don&#8217;t let others to grow (and be motivated (no ownership)) and you have less time to grow as well. Set goals not tasks.
It&#8217;s clear for you != it&#8217;s clear for everyone (clarify and motivate (how this goal contribute to company success))
How the result should look like. It should be clear how will we know that the task is achieved. We should have an artifact as a result.
When you delegate, you feel that you have less control. But it&#8217;s ok, this is how trust is gained.
Processes should work without you. Otherwise, a leader is a bottleneck.</p>
